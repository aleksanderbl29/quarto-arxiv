# ArXiv Template

This is a Quarto template that assists you in creating PDF outputs which closely match those published on arXiv. If you are intending to publish your article on arXiv, it is highly recommended you upload your TeX files (and supporting files, including generated `.bbl` and figure files) directly. However, this template supports rendering PDFs which resemble arXiv preprints for upload to other repositories either before or instead of submission to arXiv itself.

There are currently a few differences between the PDFs generated by this template and those generated by arXiv:

1. The fonts and spacings are not a perfect match. PRs to fix this are more than welcome.
2. ORCiD IDs will be rendered as clickable logos next to author names.
3. Emails will be displayed as hyperlinks, not in monospaced fonts.

Any other differences are unintentional bugs -- please open an issue about anything you encounter!

## Creating a New Article

You can use this as a template to create a preprint for ArXiv. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
quarto use template mikemahoney218/quarto-arxiv
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file and bibiography that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Installation For Existing Document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command to install this format:

```bash
quarto install extension mikemahoney218/quarto-arxiv
```

## Usage 

To use the format, you can use the format names `arxiv-pdf` and `arxiv-html`. For example:

```bash
quarto render article.qmd --to arxiv-pdf
```

or in your document yaml

```yaml
format:
  pdf: default
  arxiv-pdf:
    keep-tex: true    
```
